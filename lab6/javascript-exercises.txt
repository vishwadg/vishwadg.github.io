                            JAVASCRIPT TIMER EXCERCISE
                            

        1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?
            setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
            setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);
        
        ANS:    setTimeout(booyah, 2000); -> booyah function will be called after 2000 ms.
                setTimeout(booyah(), 2000); -> booyah() function called immediately, rather than waiting for 2000 ms.


        2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?
            var myfunc = function(a, x) {
            return a * x;
            };
            var x = myfunc(2, 3);
            var y = myfunc;
            alert(x);
            alert(y(2,3));

        ANS:    alert(x) = 6 and alert(y(2,3)) = 6



        3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
            says “BOOYAH!”
            setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
            setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
        
        ANS:    function booyah1(){
                    alert("BOOYAH!");
                }

                function booyah2(){
                    setTimeout(function(){
                        alert("BOOYAH!");
                    }, 2000);
                }



        4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
        for using it)?

        ANS:    Unobtrusive Javascript is the way of writing Javascript code in which we write HTML with minimal JS inside to separate web site into  three cateogories 
                1.content(HTML) 2. presentation(CSS) and 3. behavior(Javascript). It uses the DOM to attach and execute all JS functions. With Unobstrusive JS our code is easy to 
                debug, update and less error prone. Let's see the example

                <input type="button" id="myBtn" onclick="alert('My button clicked')"/>

                Above code is not Unobstrusive because of mix of presentation and behavior. The onclick should not be there in html, should be part of JS.

                We can write above code in Unobstrusive way.

                <input type="button" id="myBtn"/>

                var myBtn = document.getElementById("myBtn")
                myBtn.onclick = function(){
                    alert('My button clicked');
                };
