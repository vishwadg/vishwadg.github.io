            1. In jQuery terminology, what is the difference between the “jQuery function” and the “jQuery object”?
            
            ANS:    Its value of jQuery or $ is the jQuery function. This function, which also acts as the jQuery namespace, 
                    generates jQuery objects and registers handlers to be called when the DOM is prepared. Typically, I'll just say 
                    "$" (). The jQuery function may alternatively be referred to as "the global jQuery object" because it acts as a
                    namespace, however it is crucial to distinguish it from "a jQuery object."


            2. Write jQuery code to find all h1 elements that are children of a div element and make their background
            color red.
            
            Sample HTML:
            <body>
                <h1>abc</h1><br>
                <div>
                    <h1>div-1</h1>
                    <h1>div-2</h1>
                </div>
                <h1>xyz</h1>
            </body>

            ANS:    $(document).ready(function(){
                        $("div > h1").css("background-color", "red");
                    });


            3. Use a jQuery method to insert the text "YES!" at the end of the <p> element.
            
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
                <head>
                    <script>
                    <!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >
                    </script>
                </head>
                <body>
                    <p>Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
                </body>
            </html>

            ANS:    
                    <html>
                        <head>
                            <script>
                            <!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >
                            $(document).ready(function(){
                                $("p").append("<label>YES!</label>");
                            });
                            </script>
                        </head>
                        <body>
                            <p>Is jQuery FUN or what? </p>
                        </body>
                    </html>
